## üîç Highlights & Outcomes

### 1. CO‚ÇÇ Emission Regression  
- Cleaned and merged a 1995-2024 fuel consumption dataset with CO‚ÇÇ emission labels.  
- Built a regression pipeline in Jupyter to predict emissions (g/km) from vehicle and fuel features.  
- Produced a detailed ‚ÄúDocumentation.txt‚Äù plus accompanying pseudo-code and exploratory notebooks.  
- Demonstrated reproducibility and end-to-end data processing workflows.

### 2. Crop-Production Classification  
- Worked with FAO agriculture data (FAO_cleaned.csv) and developed a classification pipeline to distinguish food vs. feed crops.  
- Employed feature engineering and classification modeling (`classification_T10.ipynb`).  
- Documented preprocessing steps (removal of irrelevant features, pseudo-code).  
- Illustrated how domain data is transformed into actionable model outputs.

### 3. Health Insurance Claims Clustering  
- Processed real-world insurance data (`insurance_data_work.csv`) and developed clustering pipeline (`health_insurance_model_pipeline.ipynb`).  
- Used unsupervised learning to segment claim types and reveal hidden patterns.  
- Included full documentation and pseudo-code for transparency of methodology.

## üß∞ Common Methodological Approach  
Across all three projects I consistently:  
- Designed reproducible data pipelines (cleaning ‚Üí feature engineering ‚Üí modeling ‚Üí evaluation).  
- Emphasized **data quality, transparency and documentation** (pseudo-code, README/files).  
- Focused on actionable modelling outcomes relevant to business/industry contexts: emission insights, crop classification, insurance segmentation.  
- Demonstrated ability to transition from exploratory data analysis to production-ready notebooks and deliverables.

## üè∑Ô∏è Why This Portfolio Matters  
This collection demonstrates my ability to design, implement and present complete ML workflows ‚Äî a crucial skill for roles that require not just modelling but **data preparation**, **quality control**, **pipeline automation**, and **insight generation**. These are highly relevant for analytics and data-engineering positions in market research, consumer data services and business-intelligence functions.
